    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a disaster response officer in a **multi-storey hospital**. Each floor is accessible only by a central **stairwell** — no elevators. The hospital has been hit by an earthquake, and critical supplies are scattered across different floors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each floor may store one or more types of life-saving resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Oxygen tanks (x)**\n",
    "- **Medicine kits (y)**\n",
    "- **Clean water (z)**\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "- The building has `n` floors, numbered from **0 (top floor)** to **n−1 (ground floor)**.\n",
    "- At each floor, a tuple/or list like `(True, False, True)` represents the **presence of oxygen, medicine, and water** on that floor.\n",
    "- You can **start on any floor**, and move **up or down one floor at a time**.\n",
    "- Each floor change (up or down) **costs 1 unit of effort**.\n",
    "- From your starting floor, you must be able to **reach at least one oxygen source (x)**, **one medicine kit (y)**, and **one water supply (z)**.\n",
    "- Your **goal** is to choose a **starting floor** such that the **total cost (in floor movements)** to access all 3 resources is **minimized**.\n",
    "- You can only fetch one resource at a time.\n",
    "- If multiple starting floors result in the same cost, choose the one with the **lowest floor number**.\n",
    "- **Your task is to write Python code to find the best starting floor to be at based on the floor configuration**\n",
