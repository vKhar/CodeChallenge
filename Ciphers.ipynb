    "## 1 Null Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Background\n",
    "There are two primary methods to obscuring information you wish to keep hidden. Cryptography uses an algorithm or similar process to convert a message to another form, rendering it illegible. Steganography aims to simply hide a message so that a would-be eavesdropper doesn't realize a message actually exists in the first place. Steganography has taken a wide range of forms throughout history: messages written in invisible ink, patterns representing Morse Code knitted into sweaters, and messages shrunk to microscopic size and printed on transparent film have all been used throughout history. One of the simplest forms of steganography known as the \"null cipher\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "The null cipher is effective because it appears to be a perfectly harmless message. The secret message - known as a ciphertext - is hidden within another message by adding in a large number of eavesdropper would see the message and not realize there was a second message hidden inside, but the intended recipient would know to remove certain words or characters to restore the original message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lockheed Martin is working with the National Security Agency to test a slightly different form of null cipher. The NSA intends to embed a message within a string of random characters. Their hope is that an eavesdropper will suspect a hidden message, but will assume that the random nature of the reality, the message will simply be scattered throughout the text string. Any character that is part of the actual message will immediately follow an English vowel; that is, one of the letters a, e, i, o, or u.\n",
    "When those characters occur in the actual message, they will follow a different vowel; the character after them is not part of the message. \n",
    "For example, the string below can be read as \"helloworld\":\n",

    "## 3 Rail Fence Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Background\n",
    "The Rail Fence cipher is another classical cipher technique that predates computer cryptography. Unlike the Caesar cipher which substitutes letters, the Rail Fence cipher is a **transposition cipher** - it rearranges the letters of the message without changing them. The name comes from the way the cipher is visualized: imagine writing your message in a zigzag pattern along imaginary \"rails\" of a fence, then reading off each rail in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cipher was used during the American Civil War by the Confederacy and has appeared in various forms throughout history. While simple, it effectively obscures messages from casual observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "The Rail Fence cipher works by writing the message in a zigzag pattern across a specified number of rails (rows), then reading off each rail from top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with **3 rails** and the message \"WEAREDISCOVEREDFLEEATONCE\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Rail 1:  W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E\n",
    "Rail 2:  . E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C .\n",
    "Rail 3:  . . A . . . I . . . V . . . D . . . E . . . N . .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading row by row gives: **WECRLTEERDSOEEFEAOCAIVDEN**\n",
    "\n",
    "The decryption process reverses this: knowing the number of rails and the length of the ciphertext, you reconstruct the zigzag pattern and read the message following the zigzag path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1\n",
    "Write a Python function `rail_fence_encrypt(message, num_rails)` where:\n",
    "- `message` is the plaintext message (you can assume uppercase letters only, no spaces)\n",
    "- `num_rails` is the number of rails to use (must be at least 2)\n",
    "- The function returns the encrypted ciphertext\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2\n",
    "Write a Python function `rail_fence_decrypt(cipher_text, num_rails)` where:\n",
    "- `cipher_text` is the encrypted message\n",
    "- `num_rails` is the number of rails used for encryption\n",
    "- The function returns the decrypted plaintext message\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hint\n",
    "For encryption:\n",
    "- Create a list/array to represent each rail\n",
    "- Track the current rail and direction (going down or up)\n",
    "- Add each character to the appropriate rail\n",
    "- Concatenate all rails to get the ciphertext\n",

    "The Rail Cipher is a transposition cipher that arranges the characters of a message into multiple rails (rows) in a repeating pattern. Each character is placed in the next rail in a cyclical manner, starting again from the first rail after reaching the last. The encrypted text is produced by reading the rails sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encryption\n",
    "Given a message and a specified number of rails, write the message by placing each character in the next rail, cycling through all rails. After all characters are placed, concatenate the contents of each rail to form the encrypted message.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with 3 rails and the message \"HELLOWORLD\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "Given the encrypted message and the number of rails, determine how many characters belong to each rail by dividing the message length by the number of rails. The first (length % num_rails) rails each receive one extra character.
